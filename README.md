## Solution Approach
1. Data Collection - Source and format of the dataset.
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing - Handling missing values, feature engineering.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Visualizations and insights.
4. Compared customer spending patterns across gender, marital status, and age groups.
5. Applied Central Limit Theorem & Confidence Intervals to validate results.
6. Insights/ Recommendations

## Recommendations
1. Segment Smarter with Multivariable Insights:
Use Age × Gender × Marital Status combinations, not single variables, for effective targeting.
E.g., Unmarried Males 51–55 are top spenders → prioritize with premium lifestyle bundles
Married Females 26–35 lean into concentrated category interest → design value-centric curated kits.
2. Optimize Product Category Promotions
Category 1 is the MVP across all demographics → make it the anchor for bundles or cross-sells
Category 7 (females) and Category 1 (males) are gender hotspots → highlight these in gendered campaigns
Unmarried buyers explore more → recommend new or trending items in Categories 5, 7, 8
Older users (46+) prefer Category 10 → position it as a legacy, wellness, or home utility line
3. Tailor Offers to Age-Based Behavioral Trends
Ages 51–55 spend the most → offer premium upgrades, loyalty perks, and early access sales
18–25 are digital natives but moderate spenders → boost cart size via flash deals, gamified incentives
0–17 and 55+ show low volume → target with gifting ideas, essentials, and assistive UI experiences
4. Let Data Shape Inventory and Merchandising
City C shows narrow product variety → reassess offerings, local preferences, or distribution gaps
Categories 13–20 are niche → either rebrand, bundle, or rotate them out for better movers
Boost stock and visibility of Category 1 and 7 in urban centers (City A & B)
5. Precision Marketing & Communication
Build micro-segmented email campaigns:
"For Her: Trending in Category 7"
"Upgrade Your Game: Offers for Males 51–55"
"Bundles for New Households: Age 26–35 Married"
